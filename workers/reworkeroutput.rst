RE-WORKER-OUTPUT
----------------
Release Engine Worker Plugin consumes output from other works on the bus and writes it to files.

.. note::
   This is an output consumer and is not meant to be used in steps.


This worker takes two configuration files. The first is the worker configuration file. It should look like this:

.. code-block:: json

  {
      "queue": "output",
      "output_dir": "/tmp/"
  }

* Set the ``output_dir`` to where the output files should reside.


The second configuration file is the normal MQ configuration:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "server": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 5672,
    "vhost": "/",
    "user": "guest",
    "password": "guest"
  }

* Set the ``MQ config file`` parameters to sane values (see also:
  :ref:`Setting Up The Bus<setting_up_the_bus>`)
* Run the worker: ``python ./replugin/outputworker/__init__.py` -w $YOUR_CONFIG_FILE.json $YOUR_MQ_CONF.json``

We should see output similar to the following if everything well:

.. code-block:: bash

   [user@frober re-worker-output]$ python ./replugin/outputworker/__init__.py -w myconf.json mq.json
