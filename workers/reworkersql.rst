RE-WORKER-SQL
-------------
Release Engine Worker Plugin that works with SQL databases.


This worker takes two configuration files. The first is the SQL configuration file. It should look like this:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "queue": "sql",
    "databases": {
        "memory": {
            "uri": "sqlite:///:memory:",
            "kwargs": {}
        },
        "testdb": {
            "uri": "sqlite:///test.db",
            "kwargs": {
                "echo": true
            }
        }
    }
  }


This worker takes the normal MQ configuration as it's only configuration file:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "server": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 5672,
    "vhost": "/",
    "user": "guest",
    "password": "guest"
  }

* Set the ``MQ config file`` parameters to sane values (see also:
  :ref:`Setting Up The Bus<setting_up_the_bus>`)
* Run the worker: ``re-worker-sql -w $YOUR_WORKER_CONFIG $YOUR_MQ_CONF.json``

We should see output similar to the following if everything well:

.. code-block:: bash

   [user@frober re-worker-sql]$ re-worker-sql -w sql.json mq.json
