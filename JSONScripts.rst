JSON Scripts
************

This page provides a basic overview of correct JSON
syntax. Additionally it covers non-task specific modules that are
valid in `Release Engine` playbooks.

.. seealso::

   :ref:`Components â†’ Pre-Built Workers <components_pre_built>`
       For more information on the workers that ship with Release Engine

For the `Release Engine`, every JSON playbook must be a list at it's root-most element. Each item in the list is a dictionary. These dictionaries
represent all the options you can use to write a `Release Engine` playbooks.

In JSON a list can be represented in two ways. In one way all members
of a list are lines beginning at the same indentation level starting
with a ``-`` character

.. code-block:: json

    [
     "Apple",
     "Orange",
     "Strawberry",
     "Mango"
    ]

.. note::

   I'm not sure that we need this second way because if you parse it from yaml to json you get the same value as the first example

In the second way a list is represented as comma separated elements
surrounded by square brackets. Newlines are permitted between
elements

.. code-block:: json

    ["apple", "orange", "strawberry", "mango"]
 

Aadictionary is represented in a simple ``key:`` and ``value`` form

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "skill": "Elite", 
      "job": "Developer", 
      "name": "John Eckersberg"
    }

Like lists, dictionaries can be represented in an abbreviated form

.. code-block:: json

    {"skill": "Elite", "job": "Developer", "name": "John Eckersberg"}


.. _truthiness:

You can specify a boolean value (true/false) in several forms

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "knows_oop": true, 
      "likes_emacs": true, 
      "uses_cvs": false
    }

Finally, you can combine these data structures

.. code-block:: json

    {
     "name": "John Eckersberg", 
     "python": "Elite", 
     "job": "Developer", 
     "languages": {
      "ruby": "Elite"
     }, 
     "foods": [
      "Apple", 
      "Orange", 
      "Strawberry", 
      "Mango"
     ], 
     "dotnet": "Lame", 
     "employed": true, 
     "skill": "Elite"
    }

That's all you really need to know about JSON to get started writing
`Release Engine` playbooks.

   Now that we're comfortable with JSON, lets' continue on and read

   playbooks.
