Release Engine
==============
Release Engine is a collection of open-source tools that provides the functionality necessary to continuously deploy packaged code from a development teamâ€™s continuous integration server of choice to all environments and automate certain business processes associated with the release of code. 

The home of the Release Engines is on
GitHub in the `RHInception Organization
<https://github.com/RHInception?query=re->`_.

Put very simply: the Release Engine is an orchestration tool
(:ref:`re-core <re_core>`) that runs commands on purpose-built workers
(:ref:`re-worker <re_worker>`). The commands to run (and where to run
them) are defined in :ref:`playbooks <playbooks>` in YAML or JSON
format.

Interaction with the engine happens via a REST interface
(:ref:`re-rest <re_rest>`). Additional workers exist for the purposes
of aggregating logs, as well as sending notifications over any 
preferred method (such as email, or IRC). A bare-minimal Release
Engine installation would require **re-rest**, **re-core**, and any
given **re-worker**.
