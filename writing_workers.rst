This section contains tutorials for writing your own workers. If you
haven't already, please take a few minutes and familiarize yourself
with the :ref:`re-worker API documentation <re_worker>`.

Typical Worker Flow
===================

.. graphviz:: asset_sources/worker_flow/worker_flow.dot

Now, let's translate what this is saying into human readable words:

**initialize worker**
   In this state a process running the code representing the worker has just been started.

**listen to channel**
   Once the process has started the worker will open a channel to the
   message bus and begin consuming from a queue specifically dedicated
   to that kind of worker.

**receive parameters**
   Once the worker is consuming from its queue it will sit in a
   waiting state until a message is received from the FSM
   (:ref:`re-core <re_core>`). This message is only sent when a
   release is started.

   The message will contain the parameters, or more generally
   speaking, the *configuration* of this step in the release. See the
   :ref:`re-core â†” re-workers
   <recorereworker_deployment_message_format>` Deployment Message
   Format documentation for the specifics on what is contained in this
   information.

   **Note:** The message consumed from the message queue is a
   serialized JSON datastructure. Most workers will deserialized this
   message using a JSON library feature, such as the Python
   `json.loads()
   <https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html#json.load>`_ method.
