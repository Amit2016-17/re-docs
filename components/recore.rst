RE-CORE
-------
The core is essentially a finite state machine (**FSM**) hooked into a message bus and a database.

The core oversees the execution of all *release steps* for any given project. The core is separate from the actual execution of each release step. Execution is delegated to the **worker** component.


Running From Source

Configuration of the server is done in JSON. You can find an example configuration file in the `examples/ <https://github.com/RHInception/re-core/tree/master/examples>`_ directory.

You can point to a specific configuration file using the ``-c`` command-line option.
