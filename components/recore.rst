.. _re_core:

RE-CORE
-------
The core is essentially a finite state machine (**FSM**) hooked into a message bus and a database.

The core oversees the execution of all *release steps* for any given project. The core is separate from the actual execution of each release step. Execution is delegated to the **worker** component.


Running From Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

   $ . ./hacking/setup-env
   $ re-core -c ./examples/settings-example.json


.. _recore-conf:

RE-CORE Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Configuration of the server is done in JSON. You can find an example configuration file in the `examples/ <https://github.com/RHInception/re-core/tree/master/examples>`_ directory.

You must point to a specific configuration file using the ``-c`` command-line option to start the FSM:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ re-core -c settings.json

Descriptions of all settings directives:

TOPIC              str    PHASE_NOTIFICATION The topic (`routing key`) to send notification on. EX: ``notify.irc``.

.. _recore-deployment:

RE-CORE Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   The release engine is only deployable via source code at this time.


.. note::

   Release engine components are no fully demonized at this
   time. Therefore, deployment requires running each component in
   something like **screen**.

* Change into the directory you cloned **re-core** into
* Run **screen**
* Update your :ref:`re-core config file <recore-conf>` with appropriate values
* Update your paths by running: ``. ./hacking/setup-env``
* Run ``re-core -c path/to/settings.json``

You should see output similar to the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   [~/release-engine/re-core] $ re-core -c ./real-settings.json
   2014-05-19 13:56:00,179 - __init__:start_logging:43 - DEBUG - initialized stdout logger
   2014-05-19 13:56:00,180 - __init__:parse_config:53 - DEBUG - Parsed configuration file

Additional output will be directed to the log file you configured in
the ``settings.json`` file. The default log file is called
``recore.log`` and will be in your present working directory.
