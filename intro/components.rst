The Release Engine has two required components:

* :ref:`RE-CORE <re_core>`

  * A finite state machine which oversees the execution of all steps
    required to complete a release

* :ref:`RE-REST <re_rest>`

  * A REST endpoint which handles authentication/authorization and
    serves as the primary point of interaction for clients
