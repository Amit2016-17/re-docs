Playbook "Steps"
----------------

.. note:: The information in this sub-section also applies to ``preflight`` elements

**Recall** that the ``steps`` element of a playbook is a list. Each
item in that list may be either a ``string`` or a ``hash`` (aka:
*dictionary* in some languages, or *object* in JSON speak). Later on
we'll discuss how we know when to supply a string, and when to supply
a hash.
