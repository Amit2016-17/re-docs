.. _yaml_preflight:

Preflight
^^^^^^^^^

* **Required**: No
* **Argument type**: ``list``
* **Default**: None

The ``preflight`` element defines the execution steps that will be
performed on each host in :ref:`hosts <yaml_hosts>` before the
:ref:`yaml_steps` body executes. The syntax of each possible step
varries. All of the steps are documented in the :ref:`Components â†’
Pre-Built Workers <components_pre_built>` section.

The preflight block is executed concurrently against **all** hosts
given. When the ``preflight`` block finishes the Release Engine will
**not** pause and wait for confirmation before continuing.

   Difference from Taboot
      Those familiar with `Taboot <https://fedorahosted.org/Taboot>`_
      should note an important difference here: Currently, RE will
      **not** pause between running the ``preflight`` steps and the
      ``steps`` steps.
